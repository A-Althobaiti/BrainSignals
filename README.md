# Brain Signals Dual-Frequency Visualization 
This library has been developed to extend the visualization
of the BrainSignal library.
In order to visualize the dual-frequency interaction, the computed
cross-correlation matrix has to be loaded through load_bands(). It must be a numpy 2d array
'''
data = load_bands(path='./frequencies/')
'''
Given this matrix, a graph for each band can be constructed
'''
graphs = create_graphs(data)
'''
To apply the (PH-Dowker) fliteration
'''
filtered = filter_graphs(graphs)
'''
Now, the filtered graphs have been computed, we can get the layout
of the classical coherence as well as dual coherence. For the dual coherence
layout, the classical layout has to be computed first
'''
classical = create_classical_networks(filtered)
dual_net = create_dual_networks(filtered, classical)
'''
The dual_net variable from above is a dictionary with the names 
of all dual and classical coherences. Each value in the dictionary 
is an object of network_layout where Xn, Yn, and Zn attributes can be 
used in any 3d plot platform to visualize the classical coherence.
On the other hand, Xe, Ye, and Ze are attributes to draw edges for both
the classical and dual-frequency coherence.

Regardless of what visualization tool one might use, we are supporting
a PlotLy Network Visualization to visualze all the networks in one plot
